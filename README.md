Problem statement is defined in the file "Bungee Coding Round.docx". Please refer to this file. 

Here for the solutions firstly I am downloaded the input files 
Then I performed coding in the jupyter notebook which is present in my local directory.
For every question i have created a seperate .ipynb file for 3 questions 3 files.
At last after solving the questions, i have converetd those files into csv form(main.csv).
